## Summary

Combat is the auto-resolved battle: once `BeginBattle()` is called the player does not act again. `ACManager` steps a fixed-rate tick simulation in which every unit runs **two independent clocks** — one for attacking, one for moving — until one side is wiped or the tick cap is hit. Each unit's own turn is executed by its `HeroSimulation` (charge, attack, move); the resolver owns turn order, event-firing, and the win-check. Together they are the only system that mutates `HeroDataRuntime` state during a fight; everything visual is a subscriber.

## Overview

The player arranges heroes on a hex board, presses go, and watches. Each tick (0.1s by default) every living unit charges both of its clocks. When a unit's attack clock fills it strikes whatever is within its `Range`; when its move clock fills and nothing is in range, it steps one hex toward the nearest enemy. The battle ends when one team has no survivors, or at the tick cap, where the side with more units standing is declared the winner.

## Player Fantasy

"My composition fights for me." The player's agency is entirely in the setup — who is fielded, where they stand, which traits are active. The battle must therefore be *legible*: a unit's behavior should be explainable from its stats alone, with no hidden couplings the player cannot see.

## Detailed Design

### Core Rules

1. **The Combat system is the only writer.** `ACManager` is the public-facing facade (`MonoBehaviour`) — it owns the tick loop's public API and fires every resolver event; internally it delegates turn-order computation, each actor's opponent list, and the win-check to `ACSimulator`, and pre-battle seeding/placement to `ACSetup`. `HeroSimulation` (one per unit, wrapping its `HeroDataRuntime`) performs the actual writes — `ChargeClocks()`, `TryAttack()`, `TryMove()`, `ClampClocks()` — once told it's that unit's turn. `HeroSimulation` never fires events itself and holds no reference back to `ACSimulator` or the facade: `TryAttack()`/`TryMove()` return a result (target id, damage) that gets translated into an event. The view (`BattleBoardManager`) reacts to those events and never writes back.
2. **Every unit runs two independent clocks.** Both are `0 → 1` fractions of one cycle, not countdown timers.
   - `HeroDataRuntime.AttackCooldown` charges at **`AttackSpeed × _tickDelay`** per tick — **per-unit**.
   - `HeroDataRuntime.MoveCooldown` charges at **`_moveSpeed × _tickDelay`** per tick — **shared**, the same value for every unit on the board.
3. **`AttackSpeed` governs attack cadence and nothing else.** It does not affect movement. Movement pace is uniform across all heroes **by design** — a hero that swings faster does not walk faster.
4. **Each tick runs four phases, in this order:**
   1. **Charge** — every living unit's `HeroSimulation.ChargeClocks()` accrues both clocks.
   2. **Attack** — the manager computes units with `AttackCooldown ≥ 1.0`, in descending `AttackSpeed` order, and for each calls `HeroSimulation.TryAttack(opponents)`. A unit with nothing in range returns no result — it does **not** act here and does **not** lose its charge. When a result comes back, the manager fires `OnCombatantActed` and runs the win-check.
   3. **Move** — the manager computes units with `MoveCooldown ≥ 1.0` and calls `HeroSimulation.TryMove(opponents, grid)`, which itself re-checks range (a unit with a target in range does not move) and steps one hex toward the nearest opponent.
   4. **Clamp** — every living unit's `HeroSimulation.ClampClocks()` caps both clocks at `1.0`.
5. **A unit either attacks or moves in a tick, never both.** Having a target in range suppresses movement; the unit stands and fights.
6. **The attack clock keeps charging while a unit walks.** A unit therefore arrives in range with an attack ready and strikes immediately. **Moving no longer costs a unit its attack.**
7. **Subtracting `1.0` (rather than resetting to `0`) is load-bearing.** The overflow carries into the next cycle, which is what keeps `AttackSpeed` continuous instead of quantised to the tick rate: at `_tickDelay = 0.1`, `AttackSpeed` 0.35 and 0.30 must remain genuinely different.
8. **The clamp is a separate phase and must stay one.** See *Why the clamp is its own phase* below — folding it into the charge silently breaks Rule 7.
9. **A battle ends** when either team has no living combatants. If `_maxBattleTicks` is reached first, the team with more surviving units wins and the result is flagged `TimedOut`.
10. **`GameSpeedMultiplier` scales only the wall-clock wait between ticks — never the simulation step.** The outcome of a battle is identical at any playback speed. Speeding up what you watch must never change who wins.

### Why the clamp is its own phase

**A trap worth recording.** The obvious implementation — clamping during the charge, `Min(x + delta, 1f)` — quietly destroys Rule 7. A unit sitting at `1.02` gets pinned to `1.0`; it attacks, subtracts `1.0`, and lands on `0.0` instead of `0.02`. It loses a sliver of progress on **every single cycle**, and attack speed is re-quantised to the tick rate — exactly the property Rule 7 exists to protect.

Clamping *after* the action phases only touches units that **could not act** (they walked all tick, or stood in range banking move charge). A unit that attacked has already subtracted `1.0` and sits below the cap, so its overflow survives untouched.

The clamp's actual job is to stop **banking**: without it, a unit that walked 30 ticks would arrive holding 1.8 attacks and burst on contact. With it, a unit arrives with **exactly one** attack ready.

### States and Transitions

A combatant is **Alive** (`CurrentHP > 0`) or **Dead** (`IsDead`). Death is terminal — there is no revive, and a dead unit's grid cell is released immediately. Within Alive, a unit is *engaging* (a target is within `Range`; it attacks, it does not move) or *approaching* (nothing in range; it moves, it does not attack). The transition is re-evaluated every tick from board position — there is no committed state to exit.

### Interactions with Other Systems

| System | Interaction |
|---|---|
| Hero | `HeroDataSeedFactory.ToCombatData(hero, team)` seeds each `HeroDataRuntime`'s stats. The resolver reads them; it never writes back to the asset. |
| Trait | `ApplyTraitBonuses()` runs **once**, at the top of `BeginBattle()`, before the loop — flat `StatBonus` deltas applied to trait members per team. Stays manager-level; not part of any unit's per-tick turn. |
| Skill | Mana is gained per **attack**; at `MaxMana` the next attack is empowered by `SkillMultiplier`. The charge/empower logic lives inside `HeroSimulation.TryAttack()`, not the manager. |
| HeroSimulation | One per unit, wrapping its `HeroDataRuntime`. Owns the actual per-tick writes (`ChargeClocks`/`TryAttack`/`TryMove`/`ClampClocks`); the manager calls into it and translates results into events. Holds no reference back to the manager. |
| ACHelper | Stateless shared queries the manager needs but doesn't own as its own methods: `GetOpponentsOf()`, `CheckWinCondition()`, `HandleKillIfNeeded()` (grid cleanup + log on a kill). Takes `_combatants`/`_grid` as parameters — same decoupled pattern as `HeroSimulation`, no reference held either direction. Does not fire events; the manager still does that. |
| ACSimulator | Internal collaborator, no GDD-facing API of its own. Owns the tick loop's five phases (Charge/Attack/Move/Clamp/Overtime) and `ApplyTraitBonuses()` at battle start. Takes `ACData` as a parameter — same decoupled pattern as `HeroSimulation`/`ACHelper`, holds no reference back to the facade or to `ACSetup`. The facade (`ACManager`) calls into it each tick and fires the resulting events. |
| ACSetup | Internal collaborator, no GDD-facing API of its own. Owns pre-battle seeding and placement (`EnsureCombatantsInitialized`, `Set`/`GetPlayerPlacements`, `Set`/`GetEnemyPlacements`) and the read-only snapshot/HP accessors. Takes `ACData` as a parameter, holds no reference back to the facade or to `ACSimulator`. The facade (`ACManager`) exposes its results under the same public API used today. |
| HexGrid | Owns occupancy (`SetOccupant` / `ClearOccupant`) and pathing (`FindNearest`, `GetNextStep`). `HeroSimulation.TryMove()` asks (grid passed in directly); the manager also asks for placement. |
| BattleBoardManager | Subscribes to the resolver's events to drive sprites. Enemy placements come from `GetEnemyPlacements()` — the **same** method the simulation places from, so view and sim cannot desync. |

## Formulas

### The two clocks

```
AttackCooldown += AttackSpeed × _tickDelay      // per-unit
MoveCooldown   += _moveSpeed   × _tickDelay      // shared by every unit

attack when  AttackCooldown >= 1.0  AND  a target is within Range   → AttackCooldown -= 1.0
move   when  MoveCooldown   >= 1.0  AND  no target is within Range  → MoveCooldown   -= 1.0

then, every tick:  AttackCooldown = min(AttackCooldown, 1.0)
                   MoveCooldown   = min(MoveCooldown,   1.0)
```

| Variable | Type | Range | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AttackSpeed` | float | 0.05–1.0 | `HeroDataSO` (per hero) | attacks per second |
| `_moveSpeed` | float | 0.1–3.0 | Inspector (resolver) | hexes per second — **identical for every unit** |
| `_tickDelay` | float | 0.02–0.5 | Inspector (resolver) | seconds per simulation tick |

**Edge cases**: `AttackSpeed` is floored at `0.05` by `HeroDataSO` (see Hero.md) — at `0` a unit would still walk, but never swing.

---

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Unit walks a long distance, then arrives in range | Attacks **once** immediately, then settles into its normal cadence | The clamp caps banked charge at one attack — no burst on contact |
| Unit stands in range for a long fight | Move charge sits pinned at `1.0`; it steps the instant its target dies and the next is out of range | No ramp-up lag after a kill |
| Both teams' last units die on the same tick | Battle ends; `Won` is evaluated from surviving player units (none → loss) | Win check runs after each actor resolves |
| Tick cap reached with both sides alive | Side with more survivors wins, `TimedOut = true` | A battle must always terminate |
| `AttackSpeed = 0` slips through | Unit walks to the enemy and never attacks — the fight runs to the tick cap | Guarded by `HeroDataSO`'s `MinAttackSpeed` floor, not by this system |

## Dependencies

| System | Direction | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | This depends on it | Data dependency — `HeroDataRuntime` stats seeded from `HeroDataSO` |
| Trait | This depends on it | Ownership handoff — `ApplyTraitBonuses()` mutates `HeroDataRuntime` stats before the loop |
| Skill | This depends on it | Rule dependency — mana per attack; empowered hit, executed inside `HeroSimulation.TryAttack()` |
| HeroSimulation | Ownership handoff | Each unit's actual state writes happen here; the manager owns sequencing and never writes `HeroDataRuntime` fields directly |
| ACSimulator | Ownership handoff | Owns tick-loop sequencing and the win-check internally; the facade (`ACManager`) still fires the public events |
| ACSetup | Ownership handoff | Owns pre-battle seeding/placement internally; the facade (`ACManager`) exposes the same public API |
| HexGrid | This depends on it | Data dependency — occupancy and next-step pathing |
| BattleBoardManager | It depends on this | State trigger — subscribes to the resolver's events to drive the view |

## Tuning Knobs

| Parameter | Default | Safe Range | Effect of Increase | Effect of Decrease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_moveSpeed` | 0.65 | 0.1–3.0 | units close distance faster; melee comps get stronger | slower approach; ranged comps get stronger |
| `_tickDelay` | 0.1 | 0.02–0.5 | coarser simulation, cheaper | finer resolution, more ticks per second |
| `_maxBattleTicks` | 1200 | 100–5000 | longer cap before a timeout | battles time out sooner |

> `_moveSpeed` is the **only** movement knob in the game. It is shared, not per-hero.

## Consequences of the two-clock model

Recorded because both were true *before* this design and silently stopped being true:

- **No trait can affect movement.** `StatBonus` (Trait.md) carries an `AttackSpeed` delta but has **no** `MoveSpeed` field. Under the old single-clock model an attack-speed trait bonus secretly buffed movement too. That is now impossible — a deliberate consequence, not an oversight. Giving traits a movement bonus means adding `MoveSpeed` to `StatBonus` **and** making movement per-unit first.
- **Skills fire earlier than they used to.** Mana is gained per attack (Skill.md), and units no longer forfeit attacks to walk. More attacks land per battle, so mana charges faster.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Two heroes with **different** `AttackSpeed` step at the **same** cadence — movement is visibly uniform.
- [ ] Those same two heroes still attack at **different** rates — the clocks are genuinely independent.
- [ ] A unit that crosses the board attacks **once** on arrival, not a burst.
- [ ] Attack speed stays continuous: `AttackSpeed` 0.30 and 0.35 produce measurably different attack counts, not the same tick-quantised count.
- [ ] A battle always terminates — by wipe, or by the `_maxBattleTicks` cap with `TimedOut = true`.
- [ ] `GameSpeedMultiplier` changes only how fast the battle is *watched*; the winner and tick count are identical at any speed.
- [ ] No hardcoded values — `_moveSpeed`, `_tickDelay`, `_maxBattleTicks` are all Inspector-exposed.

## Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Deadline | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Should `_moveSpeed` become a per-hero stat (a "fast" archetype)? | designer | — | **No, deliberately.** The requirement is that every hero shares one default movement speed. Revisit only with a hero concept that needs it — it would mean a `MoveSpeed` on `HeroDataSO` and a `MoveSpeed` on `StatBonus`. |
| Should a unit be able to move *and* attack in the same tick? | designer | — | No — in-range suppresses movement. Keeps the sim legible. |
